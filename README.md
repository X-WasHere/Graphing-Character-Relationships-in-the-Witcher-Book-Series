<h1>Graphing Character Relationships</h1>

The aim of this project was to explore web scraping in python with the use of selenium and beautiful soup. 

A network of character connections was created with the aid of spaCy to extract connections. Character data was gathered from the Witcher book series wiki which was used to identify characters in each of the Witcher texts.

See the attached mp4 file for an example of the finished project. Each node corresponds to a character, with the size indicating the number of connections to other characters, this makes it easy to see which are the most 
important characters in the book series and which have the highest number of relationships to other characters. spaCy allows us to determine character communities which are colour coded, an example of community detection 
algorithms is the Louvain algorithm.
